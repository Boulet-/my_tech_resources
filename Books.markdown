# Books I Enjoyed - James Lavin

## DESCRIPTION

I read (too) many books, especially since I started listening to audiobooks from my local library (on Overdrive) and from Audible, since I can listen to books at 2.5x to 3.0x speed while exercising, folding laundry, washing pots, doing yardwork, driving, etc.
